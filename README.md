# 🎧 JukeLink – A Lightweight P2P-Based Music Streaming Platform

JukeLink is a **serverless**, **peer-to-peer (P2P)** music streaming web application built using **WebTorrent** and **vanilla JavaScript**. It allows users to **upload, seed, and stream music directly from their browsers**, making it ideal for private sharing among friends, classrooms, or local communities—without relying on any centralized servers or storage.
